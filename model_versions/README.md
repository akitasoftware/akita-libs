# Model Versions

Akita *model versions* are a mechanism to tag models with version identifiers,
such as `latest`, `stable`, or user-provided versions like `v0.1.0`.

Versions are similar to *tags*, except versions are unique across models within a service.
That is, only one model can have the version `v0.1.0`.
